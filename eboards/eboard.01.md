Preliminaries
-------------

### Notes on the Class

* Two students are assigned to take notes on each class period (the assigment
  rotates).
* Because we're just getting started, I'll also take electronic notes on this
  "electronic white board"

### Admin

* Welcome to TEC 154!
* The course Web is in a bit of a state of flux.  Expect it to change a bit
  over the next few days.
* Just so you know, we keep hot water and mugs in the CS commons if you 
  want to make yourself tea (coffee? oatmeal?) right before class.
    * You will need to bring your own supplies.
* Extra credit for tonight's MLK day talk, 7:30 p.m., JRC 101.
* I will take attendance for the first few class periods.  You should also
  preface any comment you make in class with your name.
    * When responding during attendance, please let me know your preferred
      gender pronoun (he/she/zhi) and/or title (Mr., Ms., etc.)

### Assignments

* For Wednesday, fill out the Introductory Survey and Course Details.
  Copies distributed in class.
* For Wednesday, read 
  Weinberg's "Can Technology Replace Social Engineering?",
  Berry's "Why I am Not Going to Buy a Computer", and 
  Florman's "Technology and the Tragic View".  
    * You should make sure to read the instructions for responding to 
      readings before you start the reading.
    * As I mentioned in email, I have some copies of two textbooks to
      loan to people.  Grab them at the end of class.
    * I have a few extra copies of Wednesday's readings, for those who 
      don't yet have the textbooks.  Grab them at the end of class.

What is technology?
-------------------

* Not a quiz!  Take a sheet of paper and write down a definition of
  "technology"
* Man-made matter created with the intention of fulfilling needs/wants/desires
  of humans
* Something to help humans accomplish tasks
* Constantly evolving

* Themes
   * Aid humans
      * Maybe attempting to
      * Sometimes making tasks simpler and more efficient
   * Improving (it changes; it is not static)
      * Our understanding of needs changes

Concerns about technology ... is it always this positive?  (Boy that's
giving away the answer)

* Weapons allow us to get rid of unnecessary people.
* Allows us to subjugate the environment as is our G-d-given right.
* Can help us (and our culture) develop in bad ways
    * Ignore the needs of other species

While there are negative consequences, we HOPE that technology is intended
to aid humans

M-W: "Applied Knowledge."

Sam hopes that we will look at how technologies are developed, how they
might aid people (and what aid we intend), what knowledge they apply, and
so on and so forth.

How should one study technology? (in this course)
-------------------------------------------------

* Study particular technologies (which ones, how?)
   * Scientific method - 
       * General: Form hypotheses, design experiment, conduct experiment,
         learn
       * Specific: Randomized controlled experiments about the efficiency
         and happiness of people who use the technology vs. those who do not
       * Specific: Observational approach
   * Social scientific approach - Consider the context of the things - what
     social forces create it, what effects it has on people and society
       * Consider effects on job market
   * Study by use - what's it like to use the technology?  (indidualized
     environment)
* In this course
   * Develop lenses to view technologies - Lots of readings and discussion
     Questions to ask about technologies
   *Study specific technologies - We will bring in guest speakers to talk
     about technologies

Course structure
----------------

* Most of the details are online and part of the first assignment.
* We'll look at the overview.
* Three textbooks plus lots of additional readings.

Expectations
------------

* Show up and participate.
* Warning!  Different levels
* Very tutorial-like in approach to readings for the first few weeks
    * What is the thesis?
    * What is the structure of the argument?
    * What evidence does the author provide?
    * Etc.
