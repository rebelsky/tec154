Frequently (and not-so-frequently) Asked Questions
==================================================

These are my attempts to answer some questions that students have asked
(in the first assignment, in office hours, via email, etc.)

Note that there may be some repetition on this page.

About the Course

About the Professor
-------------------

_It looks like you're teaching five or six courses in spring 2014.  Is that
really true?

> In addition to three four-credit courses, I'm teaching two one-credit
courses and supervising an independent study.  I have over 100 students
this semester, and each of my four-credit courses has daily homework.
It's going to be a busy semester.

About the Site
--------------

_The daily eboards look much nicer than what you type in class.  How
do I see what you type in class?

> Replace the `.html` at the end with `.md`.

_What technology do you use to build the course web?

> I use two markup languages.  For many of the pages I use a form of
XML called Docbook.  But Docbook is wordy, so for other pages (e.g.,
the daily outlines and eboards), I use Markdown.  I also have a bunch of
scripts to help with all of this.  You can find the scripts and source
code on GitHub._
