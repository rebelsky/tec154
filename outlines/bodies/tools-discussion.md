Left Over Thoughts on Whittaker
===============================

* Do you have leftover questions on Whittaker's presentation that
  I might be able to answer?
* What lenses did Whittaker provide for viewing technology?  What
  questions did he suggest that you ask about each technology?
* Can you suggest other symbolic objects in your lives?  How about
  objects that have very different symbolism in different context?

Recent Perspectives
===================

* What questions does Mark (Leo, not Karl) suggest you ask about technologies?
* What questions does Pool (Robert, not swimming) suggest you ask about technologies?
* What questions does Winner suggest you ask about technologies?

Applying Perspectives: The Flintlock
====================================

* It clearly doesn't make a lot of sense to try to use these perspectives
  on a technology as early as stone tools, so we'll try instead to
  look at a related technology - the flintlock.
* What do our authors' lenses say to us about the flintlock?
