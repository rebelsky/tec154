What is Technology?
===================

* I start many of my classes with a simple question: What does the name of the course tell us about the subject matter?
* Quiz: Write down a definition of "Technology".
* We'll consider your answers as a group.
* Here's what Meriam-Webster's says
> 1 a : the practical application of knowledge especially in a particular area : ENGINEERING 2 &lt;medical technology&gt; b : a capability given by the practical application of knowledge &lt;a car's fuel-saving technology&gt; <br>
2 : a manner of accomplishing a task especially using technical processes, methods, or knowledge &lt;new technologies for information storage&gt; <br>
3 : the specialized aspects of a particular field of endeavor &lt;educational technology&gt;

How to Study Technology
=======================

* If we are to study technology in this course, we should consider the ways in which one generally studies things.
* Do different disciplines have different mechanisms for studying?
* Science often relies on the scientific method.
* We might study some technologies by attempting to replicate them.  
  (What kind of study is that?)
* One strategy we will use to study a number of technologies:
  + Read about the technology
  + Listen to experts
  + Question experts
  + Discuss
* To employ this strategy, we will need some basic theories to ground our
  studies.  We will intersperse studies of these theories with explorations
  of individual technologies.

Expectations
============

* Past experience: Close enough to tutorial that I'll probably still focus 
  on some basic skills.
  + Very important for some of you.
  + May feel a bit simple for others.  Sorry.  That's a pitfall of 
    100-level classes.
* See the course Web for particular details.
