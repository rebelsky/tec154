What is Technology?
-------------------

* I start many of my classes with a simple question: What does the name of 
  the course tell us about the subject matter?
* "Quiz" (okay, not quite a quiz): Write down a definition of "Technology".
* We'll consider your answers as a group.
* Here's what Meriam-Webster's says

> 1 a : the practical application of knowledge especially in a particular area : ENGINEERING 2 &lt;medical technology&gt; b : a capability given by the practical application of knowledge &lt;a car's fuel-saving technology&gt;

> 2 : a manner of accomplishing a task especially using technical processes, methods, or knowledge &lt;new technologies for information storage&gt;

> 3 : the specialized aspects of a particular field of endeavor &lt;educational technology&gt;

How to Study Technology
-----------------------

* If we are to study technology in this course, we should consider the ways 
  in which one generally studies things.
* Do different disciplines have different mechanisms for studying?
* Science often relies on the scientific method.
* We might study some technologies by attempting to replicate them.  
  (What kind of study is that?)
* One strategy we will use to study a number of technologies:
    * Read about the technology
    * Listen to experts
    * Question experts
    * Discuss
* To employ this strategy, we will need some basic theories to ground our
  studies.  We will intersperse studies of these theories with explorations
  of individual technologies.
* We build a toolkit of "lenses" through which you can analyze/view
  technologies.

Course Structure
----------------

* Read the Web site (as part of the first assignment).

Expectations
------------

* Past experience: Close enough to tutorial that I'll probably still focus 
  on some basic skills.
    * For example: I'll ask you to pull out the thesis of each reading and
      to describe the structure of the author's argument.
    * Some of you will clearly need that support.
    * May feel a bit simple for others.  Sorry.  That's a pitfall of taking
      100-level classes as an upper-level student.
* See the course web for particular details.
