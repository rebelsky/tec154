Clarification Questions
=======================

Is social construction the same train of thought that follows the "We do not know that green is green; we only know that we call it green," approach to what knowledge is? (Pool reading)

Pool states that many scientists accept the general idea of paradigms
without understanding the deeper implications of the social constructivist
perspective.  What are these deeper implications?

What makes the author think that people know that Santa Claus wears a red suit and rides in a sleigh pulled by eight reindeer? What makes the author think that people know that Santa Claus exists at all?

What does "rhetoric of the technological sublime" means in chapter 1?

To clarify, does Winner believe that technology is becoming INCREASINGLY
influenced by the political environment in which it is conceived, or
does he merely accept that technology and political goals coincide as
much now as they did 1,500 years ago? 3,000 years ago?

What was the Three Mile Island accident?

What happened at the Haymarket Square bombing mentioned in Winner's
essay? (It seemed to be just mentioned but I didn't get what it related
to)

What is an ABM?

What is an SST?

What is mechanical philosophy?

Are there still aficionado's who drive steam-powered cars? Is there anyone who still drives steam-powered cars?

I was very interested in Winner's examples of the political purposes of some technological designs.  Has anyone studied more recent examples of some of these ideas?  Where can I find them?

Is Winner's argument that the atom bomb is political logical? I think the
reasons that nuclear weapons "require" hierarchical command structures,
is because of politics (destroying cities is definitely political)
not something inherent in the bomb.

On page 10 (in the tenth edition), what does Marx mean when he talks about technology being idolized?  Or maybe he doesn't say that ... that's just what I got from it.
 
On page 16 (in the tenth edition), is Pool trying to say that society controls technology?  If so, I don't understand how that could be.  If not, what is he saying there then?
