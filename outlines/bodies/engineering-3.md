Review of stuff covered so far
==============================

*I'll start, you add on.*

Some secondary points/theses.
* Things wear out.
* Engineering is a natural human endeavor.
* We can treat engineering as a form of the scientific method.
* Structures are often used in ways that their designers cannot predict.

Some engineering concepts
* Basic concept: We have some desired design goals and try to build 
  something to meet those goals.
* After a success, we will push a design further and further.

Some Preliminary Questions
==========================

* What is a slide rule?
* Why were there so many changes from working structures in the 
  Tacoma narrows bridge?
* Petroski quotes David Pye
  "The requirements for design conflict and cannot be reconciled. All designs for devices are in some degrees failures...."
  Are there requirements that *can* be reconciled?
* Why do we use violent metaphors when talking about Petroski?

Chapter summaries
=================

The Petroski lens
=================

* What questions does Petroski suggest that we should ask about
  technologies

Discussion Questions
====================

*We will only cover these if time permits.*

If fiction novels are a better way of "expounding on engineering design and structural failure" (212), then why didn't Petroski write a fictional novel? Wouldn't more non-engineers be more prone to pick up a fictional novel and learn about engineering that way than by reading this book? (Basically, what is the advantage to this type of literature for this subject matter?) [+ for that last part.]
