Some Clarifications
===================

Bill Joy and his Critics
========================

Some preliminary questions.
* What are Joy's main points?
  + What does he see as potential problems?
  + How does he anticipate addressing these problems?
* Where, in the reading, do you see these points?
* How do his Brown and Duguid respond?
* Are there responses appropriate to Joy's main theses?

Q for small groups: What one thing would you like us to discuss?

Lenses
======

Do these authors provide any lenses with which we can view technologies?

Open Discussion
===============

Have we already partially reached a point of being too reliant on
technology?  Suppose we had to turn off all the computers on the planet
in a month.  What would happen?

You can choose what else seems most important to discuss.
