Plans for Wednesday and Friday
==============================

Tentative (can be changed):

* Wednesday
  * Wireless video game controllers
  * Birth Control
  * Electroconvulsive therapy
  * Household appliances
* Friday
  * Land-line phones
  * Cell phones
  * Ethanol
  * Football helmets

Plans for the Start of Monday's Class
=====================================

* I remain convinced that the issues that affect people in their
  everyday lives must also be addressed in their everyday lives.
* The official statement about Saturday's events is supposed to be made
  this morning.
* I understand that there will be a number of editorials in today's
  *S&B* about the issue.
* Members of the class are affected by the event, by the editorials, and
  by surrounding issues.
* We will therefore begin Monday's class by addressing these issues.
* I would hope that my class is a safe enough space that we can do so
  successfuly.

Format
* Any class member who desires may read a prepared statement.
* Any class member who would like a statement read but is not comfortable
  reading it themselves may send it to me in advance, and I will read it
  anonymously.
* I will survey the class about what to do next (discuss, go on with class
  topics, whatever).
* I will decide what to do next.

About Statements and Discussion
* In spite of the strong feelings many feel about these issues, you
  will be respectful to the individual members of this class.
* We can express strong feelings.
  + As one of you notes, "Discussions of these topics need to happen and should put people in place that is outside of their comfort zone.  I think personal safety can still be maintained as long as ideas are challenged and not individuals."

The Final: Comprehensive of Partial?
====================================

* I have received requests that the exam focus on the second half of the
  semester.
* It is, however, difficult to ask questions of the form "What would
  *author* say about *topic*?" if I lose the ability to
  use the authors from the first half of the semester.
* It is also difficult to ask essay questions w/o being able to use those
  readings.
* At the same time, I realize that having all of the authors from the
  first half of the semester to know in addition to all the topics from
  the second half of the term is potentially overwhelming.
* I also know that we've covered a lot since the mid-semester examination.
* Hence, the focus of the examination will be on the work from the second
  half of the semester. 
* However, I will assume that that you remember key issues from the first 
  half of the semester.
  + E.g., you should remember that we should consider the question of which
    groups or power structures a technology implicitly or explicilty
    supports or discourages.

The Format of the Final
=======================

* Without the lenses of the first half of the semester, I don't think an
  essay question is appropriate.
* Hence, the final examination will have approximately twenty short answer 
  questions, similar to the questions on the first part of the mid-semester
  examination.
* You may bring one double-sided hand-written sheet to the examination.

New Topics for the Final
========================

* Technologies
  + Bridges and other Structures (Case)
  + Digital Art (Kluber and Simon)
  + Biotechnology (Robertson)
  + Solar Energy (Swartz)
  + Computers (Rebelsky)
* Student-presented Technologies
  + Birth control
  + Cellular phones
  + Electroconvulsive therapy
  + Ethanol
  + Football helmets
  + Household appliances
  + Lind-line telephones
  + Wireless video-game controllers
* Readings
  + Norman (Human Factors)
  + Dawe (Assistive Technology)
  + McGaw and Rothschild (Feminist and Gendered Perspectives on Technology)
  + Pollack (Technology in Art)
  + Billington (Bridges)
  + Lots of authors (Biotechnology)
  + Ceruzzi (Computers and Expectations)
  + Bush (Information Storage)
* New Perspectives

The Subject Matter of the Course
================================

I think of this course as having three main subject matters
* Topical
  + Details of individual technologies
  + Lenses through which to consider technology
* General skills
* And beyond

Individual technologies - *To talk about technology, you need to have thought about and understood particular technologies*
* Stone tools
* Language
* Music
* Bridges and other Structures 
* Digital Art 
* Biotechnology 
* Solar Energy 
* Computers 

Lenses - *We need to know more than how a technology works, we need to consider its effect and milieu*
* Too many to list
* I hope that after you leave this course, whenever you encounter a new technology, you ask yourself some of the questions these lenses reveal.

General - *I expect that every Grinnell course should help to enhance your learning and thinking skills*
* Identifying key points in readings
* The power of collaboration
* Whether you like it or not, being able to think on your feet is an important skill
* Try learning subjects in different ways (e.g., hands-on activities)

And beyond - *Some of what I hope to teach you is not strictly academic*
* Have fun with what you do
* Be responsible for yourself and to those around you
  + Show up, and if you can't show up, call!
* Take risks
* Support each other
* There are things in life much more important than any academic subject

End of Course Evaluation
========================

* Fill it out.
* A volunteer will turn it in to the Science Division Office.
