Small Group Assignment: Stone Tools and Beyond
==============================================

I. Drawing upon the Whittaker classes and the readings by Whittaker,
Sharp, and Washburn, suggest two or three new questions we might ask
about a technology that we wish to study.

1.
     
    
     
    
2.

     
     
    
3.
    
    
    
II. Remind yourself of the primary questions that Marx, Pool, and Winner
suggest that we ask about 

Marx (Does Improved Technology Mean Progress?)
    
    
    
     
Pool (How Society Shapes Technology)
    
    
     
    
Winner (Do Artifacts Have Politics?)
    
     
    
    
III. Apply these approaches to the flintlock gun.  (If you have time,
apply Weinberg, Berry, and Florman, too.)
