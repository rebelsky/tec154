Final Paper and Presentation
============================

**Summary:** To synthesize the material we have covered in class and
broaden our understanding of technology, you will write a a ten-to-fifteen
page paper about a technology not explored in depth in class and present
your findings to the class.  You will do this work in groups of approximately
three students.

Introduction
------------

You have now studied a number of technologies and, as importantly, a
variety of perspectives on the role and purposes of technology. It is
time to apply your knowledge to a new technology. You will apply this
knowledge in two ways: You will write a paper about the technology and
you will present the technology to your class.

Your paper will have at least three parts: 

* a historical overview of the technology, 
* a discussion of the positive aspects of the technology that draws 
  upon the perspectives of at least two primary authors we have read 
  this semester; and 
* a discussion of the negative aspects of the technology that also draws 
  upon the perspectives of at least two primary authors we have read 
  this semester. 

Note that by "primary authors", I mean Norman, Petroski, or anyone who 
appears in Teich. 

Phases
------

### Phase 1: Team and Topic Selection

You should begin by selecting a team of up to three students to work
together on the project.  (I'd prefer that you work in a team of three,
but you may also work alone or in a team of two or four.)  If you have
trouble finding a team, let me know by Friday, 4 April 2014, and I will
do my best to assign you to a team by Monday, 7 April 2014.

The team should then work together to identify a topic of interest. Your
initial topics can be fairly broad. You might study recent technologies
(e.g., the Internet, PCR), 50's technologies (e.g., silly putty),
industrial-age technologies (e.g., the railroad), or even older
technologies (e.g., the development of agriculture). If you found Petroski
interesting, you might look at his other books for ideas (for example,
he has written a whole book on the evolution of the Pencil).  If you have
a technology you use regularly with in your major (if you have a major),
you may certainly write about that technology.

By Friday, 11 April 2014, you should let me know the composition of your
team and the topic you have selected.

### Phase 2: Annotated Bibliography

Once you have selected a topic, you should gather sources that will help
you study the topic. I recommend that you make an appointment with a
reference librarian for help identifying sources.

At least three of your sources should describe the history or evolution
of the technology: What problem did the technology solve? What approaches
did people take?  And so on and so forth.

At least three of your sources should be more critical papers that
reflect carefully on the benefits or drawbacks of the technology.

Compile your sources into an annotated bibliography.   In that bibliography,
you need only annotate three sources on the history and evolution of
the technology and three critical papers.  See the appendix to this
assignment for information on annotated bibliographies.

This bibliography is due Friday, 18 April 2014.

### Phase 3: Thesis

As you read and reflect upon your sources, think carefully about
claims you can make about the technology. Your claims will likely
synthesize the positive and negative aspects of the technology. If
you have trouble writing theses, you may want to reflect on
Erik Simpson's "Developing a Thesis", available on the Web at
<http://www.math.grinnell.edu/~simpsone/Connections/Writing/Thesis/index.html>.

Turn in a draft thesis to me by Friday, 18 April 2014. You need only
turn in the thesis, but you may find it more helpful to situate the
thesis in an introductory paragraph or section.  

### Phase 4: Smooth Draft

As you have probably heard many times at Grinnell, experience shows that
papers are significantly better when they are written in multiple phases,
with at least one draft before the final version. To remind you of the
importance of drafting, I require a "smooth draft" for this paper.

By "smooth draft", I mean a draft that has many of the problems
worked out. Smooth drafts are spelled correctly and employ the rules
of English grammar. Smooth drafts include most or all of the expected
content of the paper, although perhaps not stated as perfectly as you
might like. Smooth drafts can also include a few gaps (e.g., "We need
to fill in more detail here") or metacomments (e.g., "We need to
refine this argument").  A smooth draft should be something you would
hope would earn at least a C once you fill in the gaps and metacomments.

I plan to distribute copies of your drafts to the class.

Turn in four printed copies of your smooth draft by Friday, 25 April 2014.

### Phase 5: Peer Review

Each student will be responsible for preparing brief comments on a
draft paper from another team.  Those comments are due Wednesday, 30 April 
2014. Please send your comments in the *BODY* of an email to me and to
the three members of the other team.

As you read, you should consider questions such as the following: 

* Can you identify the thesis?
* Is there adequate evidence for the thesis? 
* Does the introduction give you a sense of the flow of the paper?
* Does the paper have a clear and logical flow?  Are there parts that are difficult to follow?
* Are claims supported by appropriate citations?
* Are there tangents into topics not related to the thesis?
* How the paper consider history, benefits, and drawbacks?
* How does the paper draw on our foundational texts?
* Are you left with any questions?

At a minimum, you should report back what you thought was the thesis
and identify any parts you found unclear or unconvincing.

You are not required to proofread the paper for spelling, grammar,
formatting, word choice, style, and other similar matters. However,
if you are a compulsive proofreader like me, you are welcome to give
your marked-up copy of the paper back to the authors.

### Phase 6: Presentations

Your group will present its findings in class during the final week of the
semester. I will assign the day and order of presentations. You should
plan to present for ten minutes on your subject and allow five minutes
for questions and answers. As we near the time of presentations, I will
distribute suggestions on preparing presentations.  

### Phase 7: Final Papers

Finally, you will draw upon the comments from your proofreaders and
your experience in preparing a presentation to develop a final paper.
Your final papers are due Friday, 9 May 2014.

Appendix: Annotated Bibliographies
----------------------------------

Bibliographies serve many purposes.  They ground your work in a broader
community.  They tell your readers that you've read widely on your
subject matter.  They remind you to read widely on a subject matter.
They can even provide reading lists for those interested in a subject.

Those who use bibliographies as reading lists appreciate more than a
simple citation as they decide where to read further.  In particular,
they benefit from your comments on each entry.  When you add short
comments to a bibliography, you produce a work we might call an "annotated
bibliography".

On the subject of annotated bibliographies, the *Chicago Manual of
Style* says

> When a bibliography is intended to direct the reader to other works for
further reading and study, an annotated bibliography is useful.  This is
a list of books (sometimes articles as well) in alphabetical order with
comments appended to some or all of the entries.  The comments may be
run in ... or set on separate lines. [University of Chicago Press, 1993]

In order to prepare an annotated bibliography you first read each source
carefully.  (In a group project, each member of the group should make sure
to read each source carefully.)

The annotation for a source is usually one or two moderate-length paragraphs
that discuss

* the type of source (e.g., is it a journal article, newspaper article, opinion piece, something else?), 
* the point of the source, 
* the authority of the source (why we should consider it appropriately informative for the topic at hand),
* limitations of the source, and 
* any other potentially interesting aspects of the source.

FAQ
---

*Who is the *audience* for this paper?*

> Students in a section of TEC 154, although not necessarily in this section.  You can assume that your audience reads at the college level, has thought about technology, and has read and discussed many of the readings we've considered.

*Why are we working in groups?*

> I expect that you will consider the technology in more depth if you work on it with peers.

*Can we talk to other members of the class, too?*

> Certainly.

*Do you prefer a particular citation format?*

> I prefer APA-style references, but I don't require you to follow the exact format.

*We'd like to use a wide variety of sources for the paper.  Do we need to write an annotation for every source?*

> No.  You need only write six annotations.

*I have a lot of work due at the end of the semester or other end-of-semester conflicts.  Could I perhaps do the paper and presentation earlier?*

> Because we have guest speakers, there aren't a lot of good days to fit
presentations in (Monday, 21 April 2014 would be best).  In addition,
we'll need to identify colleagues to peer edit your work earlier in the
semester and we'll need to negotiate an accelerated schedule.  If you
want to do the work earlier, please send me a proposed schedule ASAP.  I
do want you to do all of the stages of the project.

*What formatting requirements do you have for the ten- to fifteen-page
paper?*

> I expect you to be reasonable.  So, use something like: 8.5 x 11 inch 
paper; double spaced; font size between 10 and 12 points; font designed
for running text, such as Times; one inch margins.

*May we write fewer than ten pages?*

> No.

*May we write more than fifteen pages?*

> I'd prefer that you keep it to under fifteen pages.  However, if you
find that you need a few extra pages, I'll deal with it.

*You said that we should write "a historical overview of the technology".
Shouldn't that be "an historical overview of the technology"?

> I don't think so.  Traditionally, the use of "an" with words that
start with "h" stems from the British pronunciation of such words, in
which the "h" is nearly silent.  This course is in the US, where most
people pronounce the "h".  Oh, in case it's not clear, you certainly
should not write an ahistorical overview of the technology.
